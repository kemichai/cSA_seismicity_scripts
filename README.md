# cSA_seismicity_scripts

Description
------------
This repository includes scripts (Python and GMT) for reproducing the plots from the manuscript titled
 ["Temporal Evolution of Seismicity in the Central Southern Alps, New Zealand: Evidence for Rainfall-Triggered Seismicity"](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GC012317).

In this work, we apply a state-of-the-art earthquake detection techniques, 
starting from continuous waveform data, to examine the temporal evolution of shallow-depth seismicity
taking place beneath central Southern Alps/KƒÅ Tiritiri o te Moana of New Zealand.

How to run the codes
------------
- For the Python scripts click [here](python_scripts/README.md).
- For the GMT scripts click [here](gmt_scripts/README.md).

Note
------------
Codes here are provided to reproduce our results in the specific publication.
For different applications the codes will need to be modified :)
